I&apos;ve got a passion for the web and developing services\n      and applications with performance in mind. I&apos;ve spent nearly a decade\n      working on technologies across the stack, from Java, IBM, .NET, and most\n      of the major web frontend frameworks you&apos;ll see folks arguing about\n      over on\n      <a\n        class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n        href=\"https://reddit.com/r/webdev\"\n        >r/webdev</a\n      >.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      By day, I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer working on mostly .NET\n      technologies in the web space. I've worked professionally as a developer\n      in healthcare, insurance, SaaS startups, manufacturing, and now finance. I\n      enjoy building fast and efficient web services, exploring new\n      technologies, and arguing with other developers about the value of\n      pre-commit hooks when used wisely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In my spare time, I work primarily within the TypeScript and Rust\n      ecosystems (I&apos;m even writing a\n      <a\n        class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n        href=\"https://fullstackrust.netlify.app/\"\n      >\n        Rust web series!</a\n      >), contributing to projects I find interesting and exploring new\n      frontiers. I like to write about things I come across in the wild (of\n      software), design, frameworks, and language features among other things.\n      If I find the time, you can catch any of my content on\n      <a\n        class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n        href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdpN-mQSyJ_2XJMU1kQ5fA#\"\n      >\n        YouTube\n      </a>\n      or streaming live on\n      <a\n        class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n        href=\"https://twitch.tv/JoeTheDevMan\"\n        >Twitch</a\n      >.
