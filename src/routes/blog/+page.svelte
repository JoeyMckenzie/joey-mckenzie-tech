    I write about a lot of things, mainly languages, ecoystems, and software
    design. I consider my writing a journal of technologies I&apos;ve worked
    with at some point during my career, and I&apos;m always happy to field
    questions and conversations from interested readers. Feel free to
    <a href="mailto:joey.mckenzie27@gmail.com">contact</a> me about any of the writing
    I do here, or to simply say hello!
