    I'm Joey. I've got a passion for the web and developing services and
    applications with performance in mind. I've spent nearly a decade working on
    technologies across the stack, from Java, IBM, .NET, and most of the major
    web frontend frameworks you'll see folks arguing about over on
    <Link href="https://reddit.com/r/webdev">r/webdev</Link>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    By day, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working on mostly .NET technologies
    in the web space. I've worked professionally as a developer in healthcare,
    insurance, SaaS startups, manufacturing, and now finance. I enjoy building
    fast and efficient web services, exploring new technologies, and arguing
    with other developers about the value of pre-commit hooks when used wisely.

    In my spare time, I like to do things with TypeScript, PHP (pause for
    audible gasps) and Rust (I'm even writing some cool stuff about
    <Link href="https://fullstackrust.netlify.app/">Rust!</Link>{''}),
    contributing to projects I find interesting and exploring new frontiers. I
    like to write about things I come across in the wild (of software), design,
    frameworks, and language features among other things. If I find the time,
    you can catch any of my content on

    for things I publish that mostly deal with my questionable takes on development.

    Outside of refactoring legacy code and convincing managers that estimates
    are not deadlines, I enjoy spending time with my wife and dog, family and
    friends, and sampling the latest installment of adult beverages at my local
    breweries.
