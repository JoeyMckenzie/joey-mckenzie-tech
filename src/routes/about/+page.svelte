    I&apos;m Joey. I&apos;ve got a passion for the web and developing services
    and applications with performance in mind. I&apos;ve spent nearly a decade
    working on technologies across the stack, from Java, IBM, .NET, and most of
    the major web frontend frameworks you&apos;ll see folks arguing about over
    on{' '}

    By day, I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer working on mostly .NET
    technologies in the web space. I&apos;ve worked professionally as a
    developer in healthcare, insurance, SaaS startups, manufacturing, and now
    finance. I enjoy building fast and efficient web services, exploring new
    technologies, and arguing with other developers about the value of
    pre-commit hooks when used wisely.{' '}

    In my spare time, I work primarily within the TypeScript and Rust ecosystems

    like to write about things I come across in the wild (of software), design, frameworks,
    and language features among other things. If I find the time, you can catch any

    Outside of refactoring legacy code and convincing managers that estimates
    are not deadlines, I enjoy spending time with my wife and dog, family and
    friends, and sampling the latest installment of adult beverages at my local
    breweries.
