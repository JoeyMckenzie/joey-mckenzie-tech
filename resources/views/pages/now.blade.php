                    I work for a company called <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/">Dayforce</a> building security
                    solutions for human capital management software. I write a lot of C# and .NET from 8-5 during the
                    week, working with a distributed team around the globe to make work life better.

                    Previously for the past several years, I was part of team modernizing financial systems for a
                    lending company with things like .NET, AWS, Docker, Terraform, and a bunch of other resume
                    buzzwords. I like breaking things and convincing people that you're legally allowed to deploy .NET
                    to places other than Azure.

                    I have a secret love for PHP and Laravel and have written a few things about them on my blog. I've
                    also published a package or two. I'm even working on a job board for breweries. If you're hiring
                    .NET-to-PHP-converts... I know a guy.

                    I write a lot of Rust in my spare time and have contributed some small libraries and crates here and
                    there. Heck, I even have a version of my website written with <a class="link"
                        href="https://joeymckenzietech.fly.dev/">Leptos</a>!
