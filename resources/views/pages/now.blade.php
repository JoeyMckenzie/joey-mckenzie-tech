                    I'm part of team modernizing financial systems for a lending company with things like .NET, AWS,
                    Docker, Terraform, and a bunch of other resume buzzwords. I like breaking things and convincing
                    people that you're legally allowed to deploy .NET to places other than Azure.

                    I have a secret love for PHP and Laravel and have written a few things about them on my blog. I've
                    also
                    published a package or two. I'm even working on a job board for breweries. If you're hiring
                    .NET-to-PHP-converts... I know a guy.

                    I write a lot of Rust in my spare time and have contributed some small libraries and crates here and
                    there . Heck, I even have a version of my website written with Leptos!
