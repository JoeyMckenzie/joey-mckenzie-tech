        I write about a lot of things, mainly languages, ecosystems, and
        software design. I consider my writing a journal of technologies I've
        worked with at some point during my career, and I'm always happy to
        field questions and conversations from interested readers. Feel free to
        <a href="mailto:joey.mckenzie.dev@gmail.com">contact me</a>
        about any of the writing I do here, or to simply say hello!
