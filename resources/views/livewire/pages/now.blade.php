                A few things I'm working on

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I'm part of team modernizing financial systems for a lending
                    company with things like
                    <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET,</a>
                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform,</a>
                    and a bunch of other resume buzzwords. I like breaking
                    things and convincing people that you're legally allowed to
                    deploy .NET to places other than Azure.

                    I have a secret love for PHP and Laravel and have written a
                    few things about them on my
                    <a href="/blog">blog</a>
                    . I've also published a
                    <a
                        href="https://packagist.org/packages/joeymckenzie/openbrewerydb-php-api"

                        package or two
                    </a>
                    . I'm even working on a
                    <a href="https://hopjobs.xyz">job board</a>
                    for breweries. Even the website you're reading is powered by
                    <a href="https://livewire.laravel.com">Livewire!</a>
                    If you're hiring .NET-to-PHP-converts... I know a guy.

                    I write a lot of
                    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
                    in my spare time and have contributed some small libraries
                    and crates
                    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/newswrap">here</a>
