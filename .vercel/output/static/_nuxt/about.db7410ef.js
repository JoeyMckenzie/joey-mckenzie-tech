I&#39;ve got a passion for the web and developing services and applications with performance in mind. I&#39;ve spent nearly a decade working on technologies across the stack, from Java, IBM, .NET, and most of the major web frontend frameworks you&#39;ll see folks arguing about over on <a class="text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500" href="https://reddit.com/r/webdev">r/webdev</a>. </p><p> By day, I&#39;m a Senior Software Engineer working on mostly .NET technologies in the web space. I&#39;ve worked professionally as a developer in healthcare, insurance, SaaS startups, manufacturing, and now finance. I enjoy building fast and efficient web services, exploring new technologies, and arguing with other developers about the value of pre-commit hooks when used wisely. </p><p> In my spare time, I work primarily within the TypeScript and Rust ecosystems (I&#39;m even writing a <a class="text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500" href="https://fullstackrust.netlify.app/"> Rust web series!</a>), contributing to projects I find interesting and exploring new frontiers. I like to write about things I come across in the wild (of software), design, frameworks, and language features among other things.
