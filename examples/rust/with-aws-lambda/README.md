## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) simplifies the management and provisioning of cloud resources. Terraform, a widely adopted
IaC tool, allows you to define your infrastructure in code and apply changes consistently and reliably. This repository
provides various examples for provisioning AWS resources using Terraform. It's intended to help you learn how to define
and manage infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use these examples, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Terraform**: You need to have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it
  from [Terraform's website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

- **AWS Account**: You must have an active AWS account. Make sure to configure your AWS credentials on your local
  system. You can use the AWS CLI, AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key, or IAM Role, depending on your setup.

- **Text Editor or IDE**: You'll need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to edit the Terraform
  configuration files. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or JetBrains' IDEs.

- **Git**: You need Git installed to clone this repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the example you want to work on:

   ```bash
   cd tf-aws-examples/example-folder
   ```

3. Initialize the Terraform workspace:

   ```bash
   tf init
   ```

4. Configure your AWS credentials if you haven't already. You can do this using environment variables or AWS CLI.

5. Edit the `variables.tf` and `main.tf` files to customize the infrastructure setup according to your requirements.

6. Apply the configuration to create the AWS resources:

   ```bash
   tf apply
   ```

7. Review and approve the changes.

8. Once the resources are provisioned, you can manage and modify them as needed.

## Directory Structure

- `example-1/`: Example 1 directory containing specific Terraform configuration files for a particular AWS resource or
  service.
- `example-2/`: Example 2 directory containing specific Terraform configuration files for another AWS resource or
  service.
- `...` (Add more examples as needed)
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Examples

Below is a list of AWS infrastructure and services examples included in this repository:

1. **VPC and EC2**: Demonstrates how to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and launch EC2 instances within it.
2. **S3 Bucket**: Shows how to create an S3 bucket and configure access policies.
3. **RDS Database**: Illustrates provisioning a Relational Database Service (RDS) instance.
4. **Lambda Function**: Provides an example of deploying a Lambda function with associated resources.

Feel free to explore and use these examples to build your infrastructure.
